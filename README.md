# fluentd-helm

This Helm chart deploys Fluentd as a DaemonSet for New Relic Logging. This chart was created specifically for customers who use fluentd to capture logs and Amazon EC2 tags from their Kubernetes environments

## Deploying the Helm Chart

- Clone this repo
- Edit the [configmap.yaml](../../blob/master/newrelic-logging/templates/configmap.yaml) to define the EC2 tags you want to capture as well as the log configurations such as log source, patterns, etc ... that you want to use
- Export your license key: `export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY="<INSERT YOUR NEW RELIC LICENSE KEY>"`
- Deploy the chart using your New Relic license key: `helm install --set licenseKey=$NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY --name fluentd .`
- Check the New Relic Logs for your logs and AWS EC2 tags
